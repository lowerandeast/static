Our boiler and file structure for small projects & static sites.

### Initiate
    $ yarn

### Develop

Start the development server, compile the styling. When you're done, clean your code.

  

    $ yarn dev
    $ yarn watch
    $ yarn clean

  

### Build
This will be handled when pushing to Vercel in production. However, running a build before shipping code is a must - as it is additionally informative around issues and warnings.

    $ yarn build
